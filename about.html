    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>This site is dedicated to preserving and sharing the ancestral history of Madagascar. Through multilingual archives, visual documentation, and scholarly resources, we aim to make Madagascar’s history and cultural legacy accessible to all.</p>

    <h2>About the Author</h2>
<p>Professor Solofo Jonis is a Franco-Malagasy researcher and historian by passion and duty. With doctorates in Organic Chemistry and Physical Sciences from the University of Montpellier, he brings a scientific lens to historical inquiry. His work bridges archaeology, linguistics, and cultural memory, uncovering connections between Proto-Malagasy inscriptions and ancient civilizations.</p>

<p>Driven by a commitment to truth and identity, he documents Madagascar’s historical roots through original texts, maps, and inscriptions. His research challenges colonial narratives and reclaims Madagascar’s place in global history.</p>

<p>Professor Solofo Jonis and his family have decided to share the origin history of the Malagasy people through this digital archive. Rooted in decades of research, ancestral memory, and a deep commitment to truth, their work brings to light the spiritual, cultural, and historical foundations of Madagascar.</p>

<p>This site is a family endeavor — a collective effort to preserve and transmit the legacy of Madagascar’s dynasties, migrations, and sacred traditions. Through multilingual texts, visual archives, and downloadable resources, the Jonis family invites readers to rediscover the profound heritage of the island and its people.</p>
